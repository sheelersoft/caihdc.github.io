title: Introducing the CAI HDC Github
---

The [github account](https://github.com/caihdc) (and this site) was created to faciliate more collaboration and openness across project / product teams. 
We can use our github account to easily share common code (no customer IP) and patterns and collaborate on interesting projects. We'll also be 
creating nuget.org and npm accounts for an easy way to share packages across multiple projects. If you're interested in helping, get in contact
with an existing member [here](https://github.com/orgs/caihdc/people).
