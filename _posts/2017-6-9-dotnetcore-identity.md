title: Asp.Net Core - Identity
---

## Overview
This post will go over the process of setting up a asp.net core web api project to use the built in Identity solution. It will show how to set up and give examples of it working in action.

## Installation
To follow along, you'll need to have .net core installed. I'll also be using Visual Studio Code as my editor and terminal which I recommend for anyone trying this out.

## Create Asp.Net Core project
To create the project, first you'll need to navigate into the folder you want to create it in. For me, this was /coreapitest/server

`...> cd coreapitest/server`

Then we'll execute the command to create a new asp.net core project with the web api template. This will give us some basic set up and a values controller we'll use for testing later.

`coreapitest/server> dotnet new webapi`
