title: ASP.NET Core - Identity with JWT
---

## Overview
This post will go over the process of setting up an ASP.NET Core project to use the Identity providers with Json Web Tokens (JWT) instead of the default cookie based approach. I'll assume some background knowledge on how ASP.NET Core Identity works. Please see [the docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/authentication/identity) or [my previous blog post](https://sheelersoft.github.io/dotnetcore-identity/) for more information.
